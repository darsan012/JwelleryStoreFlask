# Flask Application with MongoDB Integration and Automated Tests

This is a Flask application that connects to MongoDB and provides routes for interacting with the database. This project includes unit tests for Flask routes and MongoDB operations, with a CI/CD pipeline integrated via GitHub Actions.

## Features
- **Flask Routes**:
  - A home route (`/home`) that returns an HTML page.
  - A products route (`/products`) that fetches and displays products from a MongoDB database.
  
- **MongoDB Integration**:
  - Read operation: Fetching products from MongoDB.
  - Write operation: Inserting new products into MongoDB.

- **Automated Testing**: 
  - Unit tests for route responses and MongoDB operations.
  - Tests are run automatically in the CI pipeline on GitHub Actions.
